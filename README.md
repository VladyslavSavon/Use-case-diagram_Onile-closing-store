Online closing store website: use case diagram

##
The online clothing store website is an MVP version of a traditional e-commerce platform. The system allows customers to register, log in, search for products, place orders, and leave feedback on services or products. The platform includes two key roles: administrator and moderator. The administrator manages access to the websiteâ€™s administrative panel, while the moderator oversees website operations.
